#BitFwd GitCoin Campaign (May - July2020).

Quadrandtic Funding and Crowd Based Financing has the potential to change Venture Capital and investment systems as we know it. 

GitCoin has recently become one of the most spoken about QF models inside of the cryptocurrency and public Blockchain space. With this has come alot of attention from small projects building and developing for all things Blockchain. From Sydney, Australia, 'Libra News and Talks' was birthed and is participating in a local/global initiative held by BitFwd Community, also from Sydney Australia.

In the following statement, you will find the activities and events that was held during the course of May to July 2020 from a number of participants (list below) who all engaged in the Bitfwd GitCoin Grant Campaign 2020. 

Libra News and Talks was created and is headed by a member of the Sydney Crypto Society. Who has specifically chosen to participate in the BitFwd Gitcoin Grant Campaign, as a member seeking investment, alliances and partnerships, while also using the opportunity to grow and expand the project from engaging with the projects participating in the campaign.

By engaging in the Bitfwd GitCoin campaign, LNATS has been given the opportunity to receive the benefits of regular communications and weekly conference calls to have, and be asked questions about the Libra News and Talks online news service. From the start of the campaign, every project has shared a comment board, see here: (Add Link). Along with transcripts from each conference call see here: (Add Link).

Some of the most Frequently Asked Questions about the Libra News and Talks project so far, have been: 

1) What is the main subject of focus other than The Libra Blockchain?

2) Are you going to focus on general Cryptocurrencies aswell as the 3 pre-stated assets from economic perspective?

3) What do you see being the most valuable part of the current market you are going to be able to target as a online news and publication service? 

4) Focusing on the global economy as a whole allows the platform to cover a wide range of different topics, how do you plan to manage the workload? 

5) How are you going to distribute publications, manifests and market reports?

Other than weekly updates and revised transcripts each project has taken its own direction in terms of their own campaign. The alumni associates along with BitFwd professionals are a group of working entrepreneurs subject blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

Each of them with their own projects and unique backgrounds. List here: • Nuts finance, • SheDAO, • DAOism, ......

By offering each other the opportunity to ask questions and relate to topics through conference calls and internet applications, they have supported and allowed each others projects to grow over the course of the Bitfwd campaign by iterating on opinions expressed during group talks and campaign webinars.
